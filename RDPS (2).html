        <p><b>RD Public School</b> is an educational milestone created, carved and being nurtured since <B>2007</B> under the aegis of Ram Krishna Shiksha Samiti, and is a tribute to the memory of our inspirational leader Late Shri Vijay Kumar Khandelwal.

            We are a rapidly growing senior secondary school with <I>over 5,000 students</I> on our rolls. We have 180 plus teachers and 80 supporting staff even as we are in the process of adding more to the strength to bolster our quality of education. The school offers education from Nursery to Class XII based on CBSE curriculum. It is complimented with state-of- the-art computer-based teaching techniques and smart classrooms.
            
            Geared to nurture the future leaders, innovators, creators, independent thinkers and above all responsible global citizens, RDPS is the ideal fertile ground to nourish your childâ€™s intellect and personality. Our philosophy is to develop an experimental environment and engender a passion for learning that creates an ever-expanding horizon of success.
            
            Extra-curricular and co-curricular activities are conducted for effective personality development of the children. E-learning, a well-stocked library, multi-media classrooms, activity hall, sports facilities, science, maths and computer labs, IIT-PMT coaching, project learning, inter-house events, hobby clubs etc. bring out the hidden potential of the child and improve their academic performance.</p>
